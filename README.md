### Background
Microplastic ingestion has been considered to be a serious detriment to marine organisms, from oysters to orca whales. The majority of these samples have been identified to be one of four categories: polyethylene, nylon, polyamides, and fluorescents. Although comprising only about 20 - 25% of the total samples, this still represents about 10+ hours of analysis per study. By categorizing and filtering out these major classes of spectra, researchers will be able to focus on identifying novel groups of microparticles.

### About project
We employed TensorFlow (and the keras API because we are beginners) to create a model to classify the Raman spectrum from orca whale samples. The goal of our project is to machine learn the pattern of Raman spectra by polymer categories(e.g. polyamide, polyethylene), and let it expect the type a designated material falls into.

We **acquired Raman spectra** from Luscombe Lab. We acquired them as .txt files so that we can finally change them into image files that can be used with Tensorflow(or Keras?). We first **plotted those text data and converted them into image files**(.png).  --- plotting function

However since the amount of data we could get was less than we expected, we talked to Jimin Qian with this issue, and we decided to do the **data augmentation**   --- augmentation function

We then **created image databse** in order to load these image data into codes.

Those image data was then **separated into train and validation**






in order to eliminate dependence on the Renishaw software, which is licensed and requires purchase. These text files will then be plotted and converted into image files(*.jpeg or *.png)


This model will use TensorFlow (and the keras API because we are beginners) to create a model to classify the Raman spectrum from orca whale samples. 

Because Tensorflow is known to be especially good at image processing, the text files will be graphed, then converted into .jpeg (or .png) files to be processed. 

In this specific model, 3 levels of neurons were used in order to optimize adequate complexity with ease of model creation and speed. 


### Future work
As the number of identified particles increases, the hope is to increase the capability of the model in identifying an increasing category of Raman spectrum. This will enable future researchers to save more time when analyzing the Raman spectrum of orca (and other) microplastic pollution.

Special thanks to Dave Beck, Ting Cao and the TAs of the University of Washington Direct Program for help and guidance in learning python and machine learning.

Also many thanks to freeCodeCamp.org, for free Tensorflow tutorials.

Lastly, thank you so much to the Luscombe Lab and especially Samantha Phan for access to the raman spectrum data, sorry to increase your workflow in your already busy schedule :)
